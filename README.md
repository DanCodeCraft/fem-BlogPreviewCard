## Overview

A fun challenge to create a card for a blog preview, adding some nice hover effects.
This is my second challenge. I hope I got it right!

I certainly learned a lot from the previous one, and a lot more from this!
I'm very open to criticism, so please go ahead!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

- First I reset all the defaults
- Created the divs to built the HTML structure
- Added the image and worked on how the layout would work best to avoid having extra work when adapting it to smaller screens
- Styled following the given directions
- Added the hover effects, one for the main card, one for the title/link

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Media query

### What I learned

I definitely was able to improve my workflow and how to think about the end of the project, rather than just starting from point A, hoping to achieve points B and C.
